# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
In this challenge, I analyzed six different .csv files in order to determine how a manager can best handle the upcoming "silver tsunami."
This analysis helped to see how many employees per title would be retiring this year, as well as how many employees were eligible to participate in the membership program.

### Results
After completing the analysis on this data, I found some important results. 
* I created a retirement_tables file sthat showed each employee that will be retiring; however, this file may have employee duplicates in their different titles over the year due to promotions etc.

* I then found similar results; however in the unique_titles table, these results only show each employee once, with their most recent position.

* Next, I created a table to show how many employees per title would be retiring.  This analysis showed that Senior Engineers had the most retiring empoyees, while managers had the least, at only 2 employees.

* Finally, I analyzed how many employees would be eligible for the retirement program in the membership_eligibility table.

### Summary

After creating and analyzing these tables, I found that in order to handle the "silver tsunami," 90,398 roles will need to be filled in total. 
With this amount, it is unlikely that every new, incoming role will be able to be mentored properly, so I suggest that this process begins soon, before all of these employees beging their retirement. It would be helpful to find additional queries to help with this process.  First, it might be helpful to find a table of each position and names of employees retiring individually in order to sort out the mentorship process for each position.  Also, it would be beneifical to find exact dates on when each employee will be retiring, rather than just the entire year in order to really get into the logisitics of the new hiring process.
