# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
In this challenge, I analyzed six different .csv files in order to determine how a manager can best handle the upcoming "silver tsunami."
This analysis helped to see whow many employees per title would be retiring this year, as well as how many employees were eligible to participate in the membership program.

### Results
After completing the analysis on this data, I found some important results. 
First, 





Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
