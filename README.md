# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of six distinct .csv files to strategically address the impending "silver tsunami" challenge faced by the organization. By examining the retirement landscape, I aimed to provide actionable insights for effective managerial decision-making. The analysis encompassed a thorough assessment of retiring employees per job title and eligibility for the membership program.


### Results
Upon meticulous data analysis, several significant findings emerged:

* I devised a retirement_tables file that captures employees set to retire. However, it's important to note that this file may include duplicate entries for employees who held different titles over the years due to promotions and transitions.
*

* A distinct perspective was gained from the unique_titles table, where each employee is represented once, showcasing their latest position.

* Further analysis unveiled a breakdown of retiring employees per job title. Notably, Senior Engineers constituted the highest proportion of retiring employees, while the managerial cadre had the least representation, with only two employees.

### Summary

Through the synthesis of these insightful tables, it was revealed that a total of 90,398 roles must be filled to address the impending "silver tsunami." To ensure a seamless transition, I recommend initiating a mentorship program promptly. Given the scale of recruitment, providing comprehensive mentorship for each incoming role may prove challenging, necessitating an early start. To facilitate this, refining queries can be explored. For instance, generating a table that maps positions to retiring employees' names could streamline the mentorship process for each specific role. Additionally, obtaining precise retirement dates, rather than just the year, would enhance the logistical precision of the hiring strategy. This multi-faceted approach is crucial for successfully managing the forthcoming workforce transformation.
